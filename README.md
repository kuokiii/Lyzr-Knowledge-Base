Welcome to my **Knowledge Base Assistant**! After getting lost in a 50-page manual for a deadline, I created this to pull answers fast. Testing it was a revelation—learned a ton and loved the efficiency!

## 🌱 About This Project

I used to spend days digging through unorganized PDFs and notes, hunting for details like vacation policies. This assistant was my fix—uploads docs, answers queries with citations, and saves sessions. My testing journey taught me data parsing tricks and streamlined my workflow.

- **Goal**: Retrieve info from documents quickly.  
- **Standout**: Session saving for easy revisits.  
- **My Take**: Turned hours of search into minutes.

## 🎨 Features

- **Document Upload**: Handles PDFs or text files (tested up to 50 pages).
- **Query Answers**: Returns precise responses (e.g., `"Page 5: 15 days vacation"`) with snippets.
- **Session Storage**: Keeps query history for later use.
- **Fallback**: Notes `"Can’t find that"` when data’s missing.
